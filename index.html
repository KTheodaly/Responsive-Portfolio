            <p>My name is Katherine, but I go by Theo because it's 2018 and that's just the name I go by. I moved to Chicago from North Carolina because I love comedy and wanted to be in the heart of a big city. My hobbies include writing comedy, music, and performing improv and standup. Being in the comedy community has given me a home and community in a place I believe it would be easy to feel quite small.</p>
      
            <p>I have a lot of Michael Jordan pride as a graduate of UNC Chapel Hill. 23 is goat! But don't get it twisted, the Tarheel mascot is a ram, not a goat. It's also the law that all tarheels rock a lot of Carolina blue, which happens to be a great color on me. I dabble in sparkles, high tops, overalls, and pride myself on an expansive collection of dad hats!</p>
